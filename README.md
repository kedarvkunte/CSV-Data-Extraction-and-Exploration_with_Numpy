# Data Extraction and Exploration with Numpy
Successfully achieved Data Extraction and Data Exploration which are the two major goals in this project.
In this project, I used most powerful package for scientific computing with Python called "Numpy".
There are two datasets "boston" and "iris" which are in CSV format.
